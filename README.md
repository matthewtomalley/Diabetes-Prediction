# Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Trees

This project focuses on utilizing decision tree algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on specific medical attributes. The dataset employed originates from the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), a well-regarded source for such predictive analyses.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Data Understanding**: Delve into the dataset to comprehend its structure and the significance of each feature.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct thorough analyses to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the data.
- **Model Development**: Construct and train a decision tree model to predict diabetes outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and refine it for enhanced accuracy.

## Dataset Details

The dataset comprises several medical predictors, including:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function score
- **Age**: Age of the patient (years)
- **Outcome**: Binary variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes
